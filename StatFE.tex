\section*{Exercise 1}
\subsection*{Question 1}
The population is the cones in the eye. The variable is the number of the L type of cone. In this case, the sample is the N cones observed.

\subsection*{Question 2}
The population is the humans, the variable is the percentage of cone, and the sample here is the 10 people we observe.\\
The correlation test show, for $M_\%$ and $L_\%$, a correlation coefficient of $-0.96$ with a p-value of $1.0620\cdot 10^{-5}$. This show that there is actually a correlation between $M_\%$ and $L_\%$, as the p-value is far lower than 0.05.\\
For $M_\% - L_\%$ and $S_\%$, the correlation coefficient is $0.192$ and the p-value $0.5951$. This test does not show a correlation between $M_\% - L_\%$ and $S_\%$ for this sample.\\
We can be pretty confident in the first correlation test, as the p-value is really low. Though, for the second test, it seems pretty unlikely that the test could show a correlation, as the p-value is above $0.5$. This sample should be repeated to check this.
